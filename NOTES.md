# NOTES
* I'm looking at the workflow, seeing red on the tests... lmk if these are still in progress
* I'm not seeing the linter output either
* I'm not finding examples of the pytest decorators for skip, fail etc

* not finding examples of Given When Then
* I installed the package, but it didn't run, is it running for you?
